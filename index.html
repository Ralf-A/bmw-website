        <h2>Production Years: 1990-2000</h2>
        <p>The BMW E36 is celebrated for its excellent handling characteristics, solid build quality, and a range of powerful and reliable engines. It remains a popular choice among car enthusiasts and is often seen in various motorsport events and as a track day car. E36 is available in sedan, coupe, touring and compact body styles, coupe and sedan being the most sought-after. The cars were available either with an automatic or manual transmission, manual being clearly a more suitable option.</p>
        <p>Petrol models: 316i, 318, 318is, 320i, 323i, 325i, 328i, M3 3.0, M3 3.2</p>
        <p>Diesel models: 318tds, 325td, 325tds</p>
        <h3>Models you should be looking for based on combination of reliability, power, features and price:</h3>
        <p>325i Engine: 2.5L M50B25 Power: 141kW Years: 1990–1995</p>
        <p>328i Engine: 2.8L M52B28 Power: 142kW Years: 1995–1999</p>
        <h3> Our Choice:</h3>    
        <p>325i features the best combination of reliability and power (141kW).
        We would especially recommend 1991-1992 model years as they came with M50B25NV inline-6 engine, which is widely regarded as the best engine that BMW has ever produced.
        M50B25 features a full iron engine block which is more prone to overheating and has better coolant channels compared to aluminum blocks which were present in later models.
        M50B25NV doesn’t have the VANOS feature, which is present in all the next BMW engines and is notorious for high repair cost in case of a failure.
        Because of it’s excellent construction and reliability the M50B25NV has earned the reputation of being one of the best engines for tuning and performance modifications.</p>
